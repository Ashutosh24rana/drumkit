🚀 Introducing My Drum Kit Project! 🥁

I'm thrilled to share my latest creation - a dynamic drum kit built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

🔧 Tech Stack:

HTML for the basic structure
CSS for sleek styling
JavaScript for interactive functionality
🎵 Features:

Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on any device.
Keyboard Interactivity: Play the drums with your keyboard keys for a hands-on drumming experience.
Authentic Sound: Integrated audio to simulate real drum sounds.
Creating this project has been a fantastic journey of blending music with web development, allowing me to enhance my front-end skills and explore the creative potential of coding.
